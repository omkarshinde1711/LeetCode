# 🧩 LeetCode Vault

Welcome to my personal playground of algorithmic adventures!  
This repo is my battle-tested collection of solutions to a wide variety of LeetCode problems — from sneaky recursion puzzles to complex data structures and everything in between.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

My brainchild is organized by topics 
## 🚀 What’s Inside?

My repo is organized by topics:

- `array/`
- `binary-search/`
- `binary-tree/`
- `bit-manipulation/`
- `database/`
- `hash-table/`
- `linked-list/`
- `math/`
- `recursion/`
- `sorting/`
- `tree/`
- `two-pointers/`

Each folder houses neatly crafted code solutions with an extra dash of sweat and determination. You’ll find my submissions synced regularly (thanks, SyncLeet!) so the repo stays fresh and ready to inspire.
